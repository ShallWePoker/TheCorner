Night after night
   --- Michael Chugani 褚簡寧
   One of the main topics on American TV news night after night recently was about movie star Alec Baldwin. 
About two weeks ago he accidentally shot dead a cinematographer with a prop gun and wounded a director. 
Police said the prop gun had real bullets. They are investigating who put the bullets in the prop gun. 
The expression "night after night" means every night. A cinematographer is a director of photography who 
operates the camera and is also in charge of lighting during a movie shoot. A prop gun can mean a real gun 
or a fake one that looks very real for use in movie-making. Real or fake prop guns for movies don't have real bullets 
but fake ones that look real when fired.

   It is unclear what went wrong when Baldwin pulled the trigger in the prop gun during rehearsals before 
the movie shoot. The word "shoot" used this way does not mean shooting someone with a gun. It means to 
film a scene in a movie. The literal meaning of "pull the trigger" means to fire a gun by pressing the trigger. 
It has a very different meaning when used as an idiom. The expression means to make a final decision or 
commit to doing something. If you have looked at many apartments and finally decided to buy the most expensive one, 
you have pulled the trigger.

   I had thought hard about taking a long break in the US and finally pulled the trigger three months ago, 
which means I finally decided to do it. If I had decided not to do it, then I would have pulled the plug on my plan 
to return to the US. If you pull the plug on something, it means to suddenly end something or to prevent something 
from continuing, especially by withdrawing financial support. During the worst of the pandemic last year many bars 
in Lan Kwai Fong pulled the plug, which means the owners decided not to continue their businesses.

  The passage was talking about the manslaughter. When someone dead, normally It would be a real shocking news among the public. In my book, it is a relatively normal thing in the country that allow guns legally. Although it was a fake gun, the first thing I noticed was the gun! When I was younger, I wanted a real gun, not for killing someone, but for feeling the real power it could bring me when I hold it tight. Or hide it somewhere in my house. It make me feel safe. Why SAFE? How can we explain this violent thing could bring safe? Having a gun means having power in your own hands. You make your own decision. You say the word ! We have been told do not carry anything looks dangerous by community organization. To prevent violent revolution? There is still a long way to go on the road to democracy.

  We have been reflecting on Dr L's resignation night after night recently. 
  What could possibly pull the trigger of his resignation still remains 
  a big mystery. Has Dr L pulled the plug of the cooperation between the company
  and the organization? We can only make a wild guess that cannot be told here.
  To me, nevertheless, I have got nothing to say but I miss him very much.

   In 2092 BC Herbert , the great king of Roma, started a massive genocide. By all accounts, he was a formidable foe to every other countries such as Athens. During his childhood, his first love didn't survive form the war. And now, he determined to rape all the young girl of the world, then kill them all.
   As to why he want to do this brutal thing, it is still a crop circle.

   The metaverse is bullshit
```

##### Herbert 2021-11-25
   After reading this passage, I learned some information about metaverse , blockchain , brain computer interfaces and some wild new shit.I do not entirely agree with what the author mentioned about metaverse. He put the human actual feeling and what you feeling in metaverse completely separate. In my point of view, in metaverse world, the virtual world is more real than present Internet. Its the massive transformation of the way we feel in the virtual world, from watching on screen to living in a tangible virtual world. Hope to play metaverse soon!

##### Corrado Lo 2021-11-25
   As I see it, metaverse as a fully interactive virtual world may has a very long way to go; metaverse is not just about the software, which is delicately decorated as genuine as the reality; but this concept is also about the hardware technologies, the most famous among which are VR, AR and the late neuralink   experimental devices; hardware technologies should be the bottleneck of metaverse now. Nevertheless, I sincerely wish I could experience metaverse for real before I am too old.

   Jony Ive’s first major design since leaving Apple isn’t what you’d expect

   "That paper seal looks expensive." Jony Ive has a lot of impact on modern Apple product design. In truth, I consider Apple's typeface how to optimize the user experience. The good design in what extent can promote a product. I ask myself, would I be willing to purchase an electronic product just because of the typeface. The answer is no. But from another perspective , a product not only has superior quality but also subtle details. Then this product is different. Details determine success or failure. We should make every decision judiciously. Let's resonates with perfectionism!

   Last Sunday night, I was invited to a chorus concert at Baoli Theater, which brought me an uncomfortable sense of cognitive dissonace; the choir sang songs praising C^2P accompanied by Shenzhen City Philharmonic Orchestra; I have heared of and sang many of these songs ever since my childhood; yet I've never imagined them to be acommpanied by a symphony orchestra; being a big fan of symphonies by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc., I would like to attend concerts featuring their pieces more often.

   eat like a wolf
      Many of you will know I love pizza although I seldom indulge myself nowadays. I indulge in pizza every few months but limit myself to two slices with
   red wine or martinis. To indulge yourself means to allow yourself to have something enjoyable. I don’t indulge in pizza often because it’s unhealthy.
   New York City is famed (well-known) for pizzas. There are numerous restaurants and take-out shops that sell different types of pizzas. Most take-out
   pizza places have tables and chairs outside. There is a take-out pizza shop with outdoor seating below my Manhattan apartment. Every time I walk past I 
   see people wolfing down a large slice of pizza.
   　　To wolf down something means to eat it very fast, greedily, or hungrily. The expression “wolf down” comes from the saying “eat like a wolf”. Last
   week I went with a friend to Little Italy, which is in downtown Manhattan adjacent to (next to) Chinatown. It is called Little Italy because many
   Italian immigrants settled in Lower Manhattan in the 1880s, bringing with them Italian culture and cuisine. Chinatowns across the US started the same
   way when Chinese immigrants settled in many districts. At first, Manhattan’s Little Italy was quite big but it is now smaller than Chinatown. My friend
   and I went to Chinatown’s best bakery to buy pineapple buns to take home. I love pineapple buns with milk tea for breakfast. The shop assistants all
   spoke Cantonese and were surprised I could speak it too.
   　　After buying pineapple buns we walked to Little Italy for dinner. We found an Italian restaurant called Ristorante Da Gennaro which also had outdoor
   seating. It was cold but we sat outside. Outdoor tables in Manhattan are covered and have heating lamps. We started with a Merlot red wine and
   Bruschetta, an Italian appetizer of toasted bread with chopped tomatoes, cilantro, and olive oil. My friend and I had pizza, which paired (matched) well
   with Merlot. You will like Little Italy if you visit Manhattan.

   Being a huge fan of sweet soft drinks, I have tried almost all sorts of soft drinks in the super markets, amongs which coca cola is my favorite. Nowadays I seldom indulge myself with cokes anymore, except for occasions when nuna comes to my house and makes hot spicy huoguo. Sweet soft drinks are tasty; but they contain too much sugar. I hate all of the popular milk teas in China, such as coco, yidiandian, etc.; everytime I take a single sip of these milk teas, I would get a slight headache; these milk teas may have been added sugar of poor quality.

##### Herbert 2022-02-20
   When it comes to indulging myself, I am the master. In my childhood, I love chocolate . I could eat a whole box of chocolates unconsciously every night when I watched TV . Normally, of course, eating so much chocolate will make me fatter and fatter. But luckily for me, I don't have a problem with obesity. It probably has much to do with my love of sports at that time. Basketball consumes a lot of energy from my little body. Nowadays, without sport, my belly is getting a big bump!

   ups and downs
   Festivals come once a year, such as Christmas, Easter, and Lunar New Year. People celebrate with family gatherings, special meals, and holidays. But for me festivals are also a time to reflect which, when used this way, means to think deeply about something. I think about the ups and downs of the past twelve months and what is in store for me in the next twelve months. The expression "ups and downs" means a mixture of good and bad things that happen. If something is in store for you, it means it will happen to you in the future. Even though I don't know what's in store for me I like to celebrate festivals.

   Every Christmas I listen to Christmas carols, eat turkey, and watch the movie version of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. I sometimes go to church for midnight mass even though I am not religious. During Easter I don't eat meat on Good Friday because that's the day to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus. I don't eat meat on Diwali, the Indian New Year. During Lunar New Year I like to eat a vegetarian dish made with mushrooms, tofu puffs, vegetables, and other ingredients. It is my favourite Chinese dish but I don't know how to make it! Sometimes my Hong Kong friends make it for me but I haven't eaten it for a long time.

   Every Lunar New Year's Eve I go to the Victoria Park flower fair. That is impossible this year. I now live in Manhattan and there are no flower fairs anyway. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor cancelled them because of Omicron. She has also shut down bars and gyms for several weeks and restaurants after 6pm. The Airport Authority has banned the transit of flight passengers from over 100 countries. This affects many air passengers who want to spend Lunar New Year with their families. Will the Year of the Tiger bring good luck to Hong Kong? Your guess is as good as mine, which means I don't know.

   What I Have Lived For
         -- Bertrand Russell
   Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.  These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.  I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy – ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy.  I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss.  I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined.  This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what at last I have found.  With equal passion I have sought knowledge.  I have wished to understand the hearts of men.  I have wished to know why the stars shine.  And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved. Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens.  But always pity brought me back to earth.  Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart.  Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be.  I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.  This has been my life.  I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.

   Love brings ecstasy – ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I can not agree it more. When you find something beyond your excited threshold, social moral constraints or stereotypes of other people cannot stop you anymore, that is what going to happen. Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible,led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Form Buddhism, people are born to suffer. I am not a saints. Most of time , I just thinking of myself. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors and such of things are beyond my ability. Nobody wants to see it happen . Make our family a good life, bring happiness for the people around is all we can do! Live in reality!

   When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.

   That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.

   And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.

   I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.
