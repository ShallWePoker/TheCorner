Night after night
   --- Michael Chugani 褚簡寧
   One of the main topics on American TV news night after night recently was about movie star Alec Baldwin. 
About two weeks ago he accidentally shot dead a cinematographer with a prop gun and wounded a director. 
Police said the prop gun had real bullets. They are investigating who put the bullets in the prop gun. 
The expression "night after night" means every night. A cinematographer is a director of photography who 
operates the camera and is also in charge of lighting during a movie shoot. A prop gun can mean a real gun 
or a fake one that looks very real for use in movie-making. Real or fake prop guns for movies don't have real bullets 
but fake ones that look real when fired.

   It is unclear what went wrong when Baldwin pulled the trigger in the prop gun during rehearsals before 
the movie shoot. The word "shoot" used this way does not mean shooting someone with a gun. It means to 
film a scene in a movie. The literal meaning of "pull the trigger" means to fire a gun by pressing the trigger. 
It has a very different meaning when used as an idiom. The expression means to make a final decision or 
commit to doing something. If you have looked at many apartments and finally decided to buy the most expensive one, 
you have pulled the trigger.

   I had thought hard about taking a long break in the US and finally pulled the trigger three months ago, 
which means I finally decided to do it. If I had decided not to do it, then I would have pulled the plug on my plan 
to return to the US. If you pull the plug on something, it means to suddenly end something or to prevent something 
from continuing, especially by withdrawing financial support. During the worst of the pandemic last year many bars 
in Lan Kwai Fong pulled the plug, which means the owners decided not to continue their businesses.

  The passage was talking about the manslaughter. When someone dead, normally It would be a real shocking news among the public. In my book, it is a relatively normal thing in the country that allow guns legally. Although it was a fake gun, the first thing I noticed was the gun! When I was younger, I wanted a real gun, not for killing someone, but for feeling the real power it could bring me when I hold it tight. Or hide it somewhere in my house. It make me feel safe. Why SAFE? How can we explain this violent thing could bring safe? Having a gun means having power in your own hands. You make your own decision. You say the word ! We have been told do not carry anything looks dangerous by community organization. To prevent violent revolution? There is still a long way to go on the road to democracy.

  We have been reflecting on Dr L's resignation night after night recently. 
  What could possibly pull the trigger of his resignation still remains 
  a big mystery. Has Dr L pulled the plug of the cooperation between the company
  and the organization? We can only make a wild guess that cannot be told here.
  To me, nevertheless, I have got nothing to say but I miss him very much.
